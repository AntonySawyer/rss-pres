JavaScript might be, indeed, a bit confusing and troublesome at first, especially for developers experienced in class-based languages (*like Java or C++*). In addition to the aspect of its dynamic behaviors, Javascript does not provide a class implementation per se (the class keyword is introduced in ES2015, but syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains **prototype-based** underneath). It uses the concept of **prototypes** and **prototype chaining** for inheritance.

JavaScript uses an inheritance model called *“differential inheritance”*, whose mechanism is explained that methods aren’t copied from parent to child. Instead, children have an *“invisible link”* back to their parent object.

Differential Inheritance is a common prototype-oriented model that uses the concept that most objects are derived from other, more generic objects, and only differ in a few small aspects. Each object maintains a reference to its prototype and a table of properties that are different.

### What actually happens when I write `engineer.greet()` is this:
- The JS engine looks for a property called `greet` on our `engineer` object.

- It doesn’t find one, so it *looks “up the prototype chain”* to engineer’s parent, which is `Human.prototype`.

- It finds `Human.prototype.greet` and calls it with this bound to `engineer`.

### That part is really important, so I’m going to repeat it:

There’s really no such property as **engineer.greet**. It doesn’t exist. Instead, **engineer** has access to the **greet()** method on **Human.prototype** because it’s an instance of **Human**. This is the “invisible link” I mentioned. More commonly, it’s referred to as the “prototype chain”.

Okay. We talked a little bit about differential inheritance and the prototype chain. Now it’s time to put that into action.
Since ES5, JavaScript has had a cool little function called `Object.create()`.
            <aside class="notes">Object.create() intro</aside>
          </script>
        </section>

Here’s how it works:
```js
var mammal = {
  jump: function() {
    console.log(‘Jumped!’);
  }
};
var tomCat = Object.create(mammal);
tomCat.hasOwnProperty(‘jump’); // false
tomCat.jump(); // ‘Jumped!’

          <script type="text/template">
### So what is it doing?

Essentially, it creates a new, empty object that has parent in its prototype chain. That means that even though `tomCat` doesn’t have its own `jump` method, it has access to the `jump` method from parent.

What if we want to make a new class of object that inherits from `Human`?

Let’s say we need a class called `MetaHuman` (well, in case you have absolutely no idea what MetaHuman is, I suggest you have a quick glace at MetaHuman Wikia. In short, MetaHumans are superhuman individuals who acquired powers and abilities unlike those of normal humans after experiencing mutation of their bodies. *In another word, **MetaHuman** is just a specific type of **Human**.*

Although there is no critical problem with this code so far, we can see that there is a repetation in a piece of code (`this.name = name`, which is exactly like that in the `Human` constructor). What if the Human constructor receives more than 1 parameters, for example, `name`, `age` and `location`? Are we gonna repeat one line of code for each of these arguments?

In the middle of crisis, `call` method was born like a savior of the day. The `call` method is a predefined Javascript function method which can be used to invoke a function with an owner object as the first argument.

  run: function() {
    console.log(this.name + ' ran!');

var mouse = {
  name: 'Jerry'

cat.run(); // Tom ran!
mouse.run(); //ERROR, because run is not a method of mouse

 this.alias = alias;

If you remember from earlier, we can use `Object.create()` to create an empty object that inherits from another object. In the case of `MetaHuman`, that means all we need to do is this:

One point we need to notice is that `MetaHuman.prototype.constructor` is now Human while it is supposed to be `MetaHuman`. This is due to the fact that `MetaHuman.prototype` holds a references to an instance created via `Human` method. We can fix this by reassign the constructor to `MetaHuman`:

### Inheritance with class syntax
Above we created a class to represent a person. They have a series of attributes that are common to all people; in this section we'll create our specialized `Teacher` class, making it inherit from `Person` using modern class syntax. This is called creating a subclass or subclassing.

To create a subclass we use the extends keyword to tell JavaScript the class we want to base our class on.

class Teacher extends Person {
  constructor(first, last, age, gender, hobby, subject, grade) {
    this.name = {
      first,
      last
    };
  this.age = age;
  this.gender = gender;
  this.hobby = hobby;
  // subject and grade are specific to Teacher
  this.subject = subject;

We can make the code more readable by defining the `super()` operator as the first item inside the `constructor()`. This will call the parent class' constructor, and inherit the members we specify as parameters of `super()`, as long as they are defined there:

When we instantiate `Teacher` object instances, we can now call methods and properties defined on both `Teacher` and `Person`, as we'd expect:
```js
let snape = new Teacher('Severus', 'Snape', 58, 'M', 
['Potions'], 'Dark arts', 5);

snape.greeting(); // Hi! I'm Severus.
snape.farewell(); // Severus has left the building. Bye for now.
snape.age // 58
snape.subject; // Dark arts
```
Like we did with Teachers, we could create other subclasses of `Person` to make them more specialized without modifying the base class.

Particularly after this last article, you might be thinking "woo, this is complicated". Well, you are right. Prototypes and inheritance represent some of the most complex aspects of JavaScript, but a lot of JavaScript's power and flexibility comes from its object structure and inheritance, and it is worth understanding how it works.

In a way, you use inheritance all the time. Whenever you use various features of a Web API , or methods/properties defined on a built-in browser object that you call on your strings, arrays, etc., you are implicitly using inheritance.

In terms of using inheritance in your own code, you probably won't use it often, especially to begin with, and in small projects. It is a waste of time to use objects and inheritance just for the sake of it when you don't need them. But as your code bases get larger, you are more likely to find a need for it. If you find yourself starting to create a number of objects that have similar features, then creating a generic object type to contain all the shared functionality and inheriting those features in more specialized object types can be convenient and useful.

When using inheritance, you are advised to not have too many levels of inheritance, and to keep careful track of where you define your methods and properties. It is possible to start writing code that temporarily modifies the prototypes of built-in browser objects, but you should not do this unless you have a really good reason. Too much inheritance can lead to endless confusion, and endless pain when you try to debug such code.

Ultimately, objects are just another form of code reuse, like functions or loops, with their own specific roles and advantages. If you find yourself creating a bunch of related variables and functions and want to track them all together and package them neatly, an object is a good idea. Objects are also very useful when you want to pass a collection of data from one place to another. Both of these things can be achieved without use of constructors or inheritance. If you only need a single instance of an object, then you are probably better off just using an object literal, and you certainly don't need inheritance.
